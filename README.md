- **Multiple ML Algorithms**: 
  - **Regression**: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, SVR
  - **Classification**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM
- **Automatic Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Missing value imputation
  - Categorical variable encoding
  - Feature scaling
- **Model Validation**: Intelligent model type validation based on target variable characteristics
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics for both regression and classification
- **Model Persistence**: Save trained models for future use
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 90%+ test coverage with unit, integration, and edge case tests
